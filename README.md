Sboty Project
=============

Messaging Multiprotocol Application (bot) with automated responses
using the AIML standard libraries.


Requirements
------------

* xmpp
* msn_lib (included and modified to fix deprecated methods)

You can install xmpp, using:

    pip install xmpppy


Usage
-----

* Rename **chatbot_settings.xml.EDITME** to **chatbot_settings.xml**.
* Edit chatbot_settings.xml filling the data required by each tag.
* Run **chatbot_gtalk_setup.py** or **chatbot_msn_setup.py** according
  to what service you will be using.
* To debug the AI, you can use/modify the scripts: all_questions.py
  (to show all questions being asked) or show_unanswered.py (to show
  only the unanswered ones).
* If you need to change the logic or the content of the replies, change
  the corresponding files in the *intelligence* drawer.

AIML Reference

Notes
-----

You can copy or modify the chatbot_gtalk_setup.py to accommodate to any service.
Nowadays most messaging services use the xmpp protocol, so it should
be simple to accommodate other providers.
